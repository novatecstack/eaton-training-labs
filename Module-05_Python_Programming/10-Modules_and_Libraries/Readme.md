# 5.10 Python Modules and Libraries
  
## 5.10.1 Python Packages
   - Python packages are basically a directory of a collection of modules.
   - Packages allow the hierarchical structure of the module namespace. 
   - To be considered a package (or subpackage), a directory must contain a file named __init__.py. 
   - The __init__.py file usually includes the initialization code for the corresponding package.
   
## 5.10.2 Python Modules
   - A Python Module is basically a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension .py.
   - You may choose to define functions, classes, or variables in a module.
   - You can also include runnable code in modules.

## 5.10.3 Python Libraries
   - Python library contains a collection of related modules and packages.
   - Library term is often used interchangeably with “Python package” because packages can also contain modules and other packages (subpackages).
   - However, it is often assumed that while a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of packages.
   
   There are thousands of useful libraries available today. I’ll give just a few examples:
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Logging
   - Requests
   - NumPy
   - OpenPyxl
