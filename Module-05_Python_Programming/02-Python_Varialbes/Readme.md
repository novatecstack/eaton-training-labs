# 5.2 Python Variables
  Varialbes are used to store any values while constructing the logic or program execution.
  
## 5.2.1 Working with Python Variables
   - In Python, you can define a variable by simply a string  | no need to specify the data type of the variable.
   - Data type of the variable is automatically identified by the Python based on the value it stores.
     ```
     num1 = 10
     num2 = 20
     sum = num1+num2
     print("The addition of {} and {} is {}".format(num1,num2,sum))
     ```
     In the above example, num1, num2 and sum are the variables which are storing some values.
   - You can change the variable type after they have been set.
   - If you want to explicity specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting:
     ```
     num1 = str(3)    # num1 will be '3' (a string)
     num2 = int(3)    # num2 will be 3 (an integer)
     num3 = float(3)  # num3 will be 3.0 (a float)
     ```
